# KiddosBot Help!

This is a list of commands you can use with me.
Prefix: <prefix>

`\help`
Brings up this help text :)

`\t`
Brings up a new trivia question in #trivia. This command only works in #trivia.

`\a <n>`
Answers the current trivia question, if it exists. All trivia questions are multiple-chice, so `n` should be an integer in the appropriate range.

`\balance`
Tells you your current score.
